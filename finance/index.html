            <h3>A Different kind of Technical Analysis adjusted with Gareth Soloway:</h3>
            <img src="/files/meandgareth.png" alt="Technical Analysis Image" width="600">
            <p>
                I have been watching a technical analysis video at Kitconews Youtube channel,
                The analyst was Geareth Soloway invited by Kitconews, He started with BTC then gold,
                silver, copper, S&P, Amazon, Apple, Palantir etc. 
                Few days later he also share the same gold analysis in his personal Youtube channel. 
                I found when he was showing his analysis about Gold; 
                was describing a very interesting kind of technical analogy in technical chart for two different time period. 
                He have been in weekly chart and two window had been open one is end of 1979 and one is nowadays end of 2025 chart. 
                I just impressed after showing this analysis and <b>I immediately jump on gold chart to play 
                with this kind of hot analysis and what I found is that you would probably like if you are really involve with gold</b>.

            <h3>A Different kind of Technical Analysis about Gold; adjusted with Gareth Soloway:</h3>
            <p>
                I have been watching a technical analysis video at Kitconews Youtube channel,
                The analyst was Geareth Soloway invited by Kitconews, He started with BTC then gold,
                silver, copper, S&P, Amazon, Apple, Palantir etc. 
                Few days later he also share the same gold analysis in his personal Youtube channel. 
                I found when he was showing his analysis about Gold; 
                was describing a very interesting kind of technical analogy in technical chart for two different time period. 
                He have been in weekly chart and two window had been open one is end of 1979 and one is nowadays end of 2025 chart. 
                I just impressed after showing this analysis and <b>I immediately jump on gold chart to play 
                with this kind of hot analysis and what I found is that you would probably like if you are really involve with gold</b>.
            </p>

            </figure>
            <p>
                Look at the chart there are exactly 9 bullish candle in both situation after end of 9 candle market down to a crazy bearish up to previous swing high, in 1979 which he showed with a horizontal ray. Now look at the 2025 chart market is exactly same situation technically and its going down to touch previous swing high’s horizontal line just like 1979 after straight bull run. In both situation a up movement, little side wise consolidation, 9 bullish candle and from 10th candle market is going down to its correction. According to this analysis market should down around $3500/$3600 level bdfore start another bull run to $5000. Although he is bullish side of gold long time. (we know the de-dollarization movement, huge debt of federal reserve, and a probable bad future of fiat currency). I also bullish side of both gold and silver but market needs correction before going just straight bullish. Gareth says people are very obsessed with one of the of the easiest trade which is execute long trade in gold but market has its own weird way to out most of them before starting a new al time high. And we all know its a big fact. I really found my philosophy about this analysis is pretty similar with Gareth.

            <h2>
                What I found about that technical analysis in the same chart:
            </h2>
            <p>
                What I found about that bearish movement after 9 candle strong bullish market is the history of gold weekly chart several time. I found similar behavior of market repeated in 2009, 2011 and also in 2020. And me as a analyst I also believe market most probably going to make that analogy true again. Donald Trump’s Tariff dividend announcement indicating a tariff recognition long time by not only Govt. but also citizen. Which Can drive USD bullish for a period of time, which will help to make this analogy true with 2025. Let’s break down one by one.

            <p>
                At the end of the 2009, Look at the chart before going another all time high; after 9 candle and from 10th candle market market going back previous swing high support and start the crazy bullish movement again. Similar situation is happening with end of 2025 according to Gareth.
            </p>
            <h3>
                2011's Nine Candle Magic:

            </figure>
            <p>
               In 2011 the price repeat the same scenario again up move, little consolidation, exactly 9 candle bullish movement and then going back to the previous swing low from where 9 candle started after touching that level with a double bottom price is going it’s own way of new all time high. 
            </p>
            <h3>
                2020's Nine Candle Magic:
            </h3>

            <p>
                At the end of 2020 market going high from July make a little consolidation and start it’s 9 candle movement. After 9th candle a crazy bearish candle appear on the chart, which is came back at the zone from where first candle of nine has been started.After touching that level market is going another new higher high movement.
